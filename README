SWAMP 1.6.1 (http://swamp.sf.net)
---------
Date: 

SWAMP is a flexible, java based workflow server that runs on top of tomcat.

  New features in 1.1:
  
  - a default GUI (Startpage, navigation menu) is automatically generated 
    for available Workflows
  - SWAMP now has its own usermanagement which makes it independant of turbines one.
  - Role based SWAMP: Workflows can define roles and workflow-actions can 
    be restricted to these roles. Standard roles are "admin", "user", "starter".

    takes care of the permission checking.

  New features in 1.0:
  
  - SWAMP is now scaling to a much higher amount of workflows by using the MySQL DB as a transparent backend.
    (memory footprint and performance are independent of total number of existing workflow instances)
  - Using a workflow cache of configureable size shortens the access time to popular workflows
  - Filtered + sorted workflowlists are generated by filters, that are mapped directly to SQL statements
  - Workflows do not have an explicit attribute "state" anymore, the state is mapped implicitely by the workflows active nodes.
    (exception: Nodes may specify a type: start|end; Workflows with an active node of type "end" return false on isRunning())
  - Actions can be marked as "optional" to be only displayed on the workflows detail page. 
    (useful for "cancel", "finish" and other "standard" actions)
  - Active nodes will stay active when a workflow is finished
  - Mail-Templates are now scriptable, allowing IF-THEN-ELSE and so on.
  - Non-reachable Bugzilla does not block workflows
  
  GUI: 
  - More friendly color scheme
  - persistently collapsable areas in the navigation bar for the different workflow navigations
  - Print-view of workflow lists
  - new column type "progress-bar" for showing progress based on reached milestones
  - the Task page also shows reached milestones
  - workflow list page displays configureable amount of items, browseable.
  - Error fields are highlighted red.
  
  
  Features of version 1.0RC1:
  
  - Workflows can attach Subworkflows and interact with them
  - A Workflows Dataset can be shared with other Workflows.
  - External Scripts can read/write data to a Workflow and trigger Events to change a Workflows state.
  - Automated fetching of data from Novell Bugzilla and storing in a Workflows Dataset.
  - Flexible versioning of Workflows by reading every version of a Workflow-type from a "Resource-Bundle". This contains the XML-Workflow Definition, Icons, E-Mail templates, and special Workflow configuration files.
  - Each Workflow can be configured to send Notifications with dynamic content at a certain state.
  - A Workflow can be extended with non-SWAMP functionality by referencing a Java Class in the Workflow Definition File.
  - The Workflow-List can be configured with filters and custom columns to best fit the Workflows needs.
